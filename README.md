# Reddit Automation Bot

## Overview
This project is a Python-based Reddit automation bot designed to automate certain tasks on Reddit, such as posting, commenting, or liking posts based on predefined rules. The bot interacts with the Reddit API using `praw`, a Python wrapper for Reddit's API, and performs actions like posting to subreddits, upvoting/downvoting, and commenting based on specific conditions.

## Features
- Automated posting on specific subreddits.
- Ability to comment on posts that match certain keywords.
- Upvote or downvote posts based on user-defined conditions.
- Customizable scheduling for actions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `praw` (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- `time` (For scheduling tasks)
- `schedule` (For task scheduling)
